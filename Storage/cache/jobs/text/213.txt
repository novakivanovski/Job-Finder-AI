Highlight your relevant skills and experience, convincing us that you meet at least some of the job requirements. Give us (or point us to) a sample of your code that you like Have an introductory phone call with us, wherein you will tell us about yourself, and respond when we ask you for a scintillating anecdote Be able to come to our office in Newmarket for an in-person interview.

We are looking to add a new member to the technical team, as a result of an internal transfer to a new position. We need someone with strong UI/UX experience, strong knowledge of CSS, javascript, templating and frameworks, who also knows their way around PHP and a database. I hate to use the phrase, but “full-stack” is not far off, though we expect this position to be roughly 50% design and UI/UX work. We are a small team - this position is for the 5th person with technical responsibilities - in a modestly-sized company. Our primary responsibility is for aecdaily.com, but we also develop and maintain sites for reporting, management, and course authoring. There are also a variety of customer-specific sites, along with various other internal projects, and projects for related companies. We have lots of projects in the pipeline, and we can keep you well-occupied, with variety that won't let you be bored. Job Requirements Technical and Working Environment We need someone who is largely self-directed and can work independently - we don't micro-manage, but we won't leave you hanging out to dry either. Dress code is casual, and work hours are flexible, as long as your time is productive and your results are good. How to Apply To apply If selected for an interview, we will expect you to There should be no need to say this, but we welcome applicants from any ethnic, cultural or religious background, or sexual orientation. And our brand new office is accessible and we have a couple of treadmill desks, if you are so inclined. Job Types: Full-time, Permanent Experience: Language: Apply Now
