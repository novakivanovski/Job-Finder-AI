# Job-Finder-AI
This program will crawl job posting websites and index job postings into a data structure for further processing. The job description will be extracted from each job. The description will be compared to a set of predetermined keywords and any matches will be saved. A Naive Bayesian filter is then used to determine the job relevancy based on previous classification.
